            <h3>Intensity cyclone Tracker</h3>
            <p>Traditional methods for Intensity estimation require accurate center determination for intensity estimation. intensity estimation during the initial stage of cyclone formation when determination of accurate center becomes difficult. Sequence We have used python along with html, css and created a Website that intimates and alerts the user when there is a cyclone approaching. In this basic case we have only created a website, on given time we would complete the app creation
                This calculates the data of two images (one live and other one of past years) It checks the similarity between the two images and the data given it it. Then it provides the output whether the probability of cyclone is less or more We have used python, tensorflow, keras software for this project.
                <br><br>
                BENEFITS:-
                <br><br>
                Using this application we can predict the intensity of the cyclone approaching and alert the areas in the region of vulnerability
                It can be used even by a illiterate person to know about the cyclone approaching</p>
